# Nokia Solitaire

**What if the Nokia 3310 had solitaire?**


## About

This project was created in a few days for [Nokia Jam 5](https://itch.io/jam/nokiajam5) and can be played [here](https://rhythmlynx.itch.io/nokia-jam-5). The goal was to make something matching the restrictions of the old indestructible Nokia 3310 phone. The main constraints were the two-color palette and the 84x48 resolution.

I find it fun to reimagine common software under such tight constraints. My [Nokia Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/nokiajam3) entry was the [Nokia eReader](https://rhythmlynx.itch.io/nokia-jam-3), a book reading app. The source code for that one is [also available](https://github.com/ConnorHalford/nokia-jam-3).


## Licenses

The source code for this project is available under the [MIT license](LICENSE). The game was made using the Unity engine.
